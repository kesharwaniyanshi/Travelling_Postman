### Key Features:
1. **Dynamic Mail Transmission System**: Developed using **Next.js** for a responsive frontend and **PostgreSQL** for robust database management, this system ensures seamless integration of routing operations.
2. **Optimized Routing**: Implements the **A*** algorithm to predict optimal delivery routes, considering:
   - Historical data
   - Seasonal festivals
   - Climatic conditions
   This approach outperforms the traditional **A * algorithm**, enhancing decision-making and reducing delivery time by 30%.
3. **Real-Time Node Safety Assessment**: Integrates self-learning algorithms that analyze real-time data from:
   - Weather updates
   - News reports
   - Social media
   This ensures safe and efficient mail transmission.
4. **Multi-Mode Transportation Support**: Facilitates dynamic route planning across different modes of transportation, enabling better resource utilization.
